:: BULL ::

This is a very fast, complete and powerful AJAX library.

BULL is the fastest, smallest, most stable and complete AJAX library/system on the world!
BULL is also free and open source.

How to use:
var my_bull = new bull();

my_bull options are:
    1. .data(url, data, element_id, content_fill_mode, success_callback, request_time_out, fail_callback)
    2. .request(url, data, ajax_mode, success_callback, request_time_out, fail_callback)

Enjoy!
